##Setup and run instructions.
no need to setup any thing just click run and debug in vscode then project automatically runs 

##Overview of Project Structure
index.html – Main structure of the web app
styles.css – Styling for layout, dark mode, and responsive design
script.js – Functionality like add/edit/delete, search, filter, and pagination
README.md – This documentation file

##Challenges Faced:
Making sure filtering and searching work together smoothly

Managing form state while switching between "Add" and "Edit"

Designing a layout that works well on mobile and desktop

##What I'd Improve with More Time:
Add local storage or backend to save data permanently

Show error/success messages when forms are submitted

Improve accessibility and keyboard navigation

Add confirmation before deleting employees
