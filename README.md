##Challenges Faced:
Making sure filtering and searching work together smoothly

Managing form state while switching between "Add" and "Edit"

Designing a layout that works well on mobile and desktop

##What I'd Improve with More Time:
Add local storage or backend to save data permanently

Show error/success messages when forms are submitted

Improve accessibility and keyboard navigation

Add confirmation before deleting employees
